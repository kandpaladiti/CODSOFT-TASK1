## Task 1 - Number Guessing Game
### Overview
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. The game generates a random number within a specified range and prompts the user to guess the number with feedback until the correct number is guessed.

### Features
- Random Number Generation: Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- User Input & Feedback: Prompts the user to guess the number and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Attempt Limitation: Limits the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
- Multiple Rounds: Allows users to play multiple rounds.
- Scoring System: Displays the user's score based on the number of attempts or rounds won.
